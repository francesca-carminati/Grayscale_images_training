Description: # Classification toolkit
        
         * Decouple training from project configuration.
         * Uses `sacred` (https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred) for logging and bookkeeping.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Due to some unresolved issues regarding paths to resources, this is the way to
        install the package (will be fixed properly in the futureâ„¢).
        
        `pip install -e .`
        
        Also install additional pip packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
        
        ## Usage
        
         1. Make sure that the mongodb for sacred is running (refer to
            https://github.com/vivekratnavel/omniboard/blob/master/docs/quick-start.md#docker-compose).
         2. Create your own konfiguration.py file from template using command
            `pd-init.py`. Using option `--task TASK` you can start from different
            templates (currently `classification` for multiclass classification and
            `mlc` for multilabel classification).
         3. Edit generated file `konfiguration.py`, redefining the required functions
            and variables.
         4. Start an omniboard instance on your machine, using command
            `docker-compose up -d` while in the `extra/omniboard` folder.
         5. Launch training `pd-train.py`, possibly overriding default parameters using
            the Sacred syntax: e.g. `pd-train.py with lr=1e-5 batch_size=32`
